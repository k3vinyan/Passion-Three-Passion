# Passion-Three-Passion


For my phase 3 passion project I wanted to create something that I will enjoy and would push me into continuing 
working on pass my phase.  I have always been interested in making a video game but never know how I would go about
it but now I have some knowledge to create one I decided that it was good time to start.

##Project Hero

Project Hero is a simple game that uses the CreateJS library.  CreateJS library has all the components needed to make
a game which is essential reason I decided to choice its platform over others.  All the smallers libraries with 
CreateJS(EaselJS, TweenJS, SoundJS, and PreloadJS) provides any developers to efficiently create beautiful and 
colorful games with ease.

###How it works
Essentially you take control of a hero and battle enemies until you reach the final stage.  Pretty standard gameplay
overall.  Currently you can move only left/right and attack with your sword.  In later revision, I want to add a 
jump function and add some power up to give the game move variety.

##Contribution
Feel free to clone the game and try it out. There's no need for setup and the game is ready to go.  If you like to 
contribute to this project, by all means do a pull request.

Thanks!
