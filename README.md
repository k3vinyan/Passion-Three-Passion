# Project-Hero

##Description

Project Hero is a simple game that uses the CreateJS library.  CreateJS library has all the components needed to make
a game which is essential reason I decided to choice its platform over others.  All the smallers libraries with 
CreateJS(EaselJS, TweenJS, SoundJS, and PreloadJS) provides any developers to efficiently create beautiful and 
colorful games with ease.

Essentially you take control of a hero and battle enemies until you reach the final stage.  Pretty standard gameplay
overall.  Currently you can move only left/right and attack with your sword.  In later revision, I want to add a 
jump function and add some power up to give the game move variety.
